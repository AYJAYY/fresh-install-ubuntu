**[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@ayjayy/fresh-install-ubuntu-server-all-in-one-script-e72d7186637d)**

## Overview
This bash script is designed to automate the process of setting up and securing a fresh Ubuntu-based server system. It performs a series of tasks including updating the system, installing essential packages, configuring Git, setting up SSH with enhanced security measures, configuring the UFW firewall and fail2ban for improved system protection, creating useful bash aliases, and performing system cleanup.

## Usage
**Quick Method**
- `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AYJAYY/fresh-install-ubuntu/main/fiu.sh)`[^1]
[^1]: Given that many individuals hesitate to curl content straight into bash, we advise utilizing the alternative method and inspecting the source code to validate the commands being executed.

**Alternative Method**

- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AYJAYY/fresh-install-ubuntu/main/fiu.sh`
- `chmod +x ./fiu.sh`
- Run as non-root user
  - `./fiu.sh`
